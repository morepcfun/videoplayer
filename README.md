I originally created this video player because I've always been annoyed by the low volume of many laptops, especially Chromebooks, which are my favorite computers in every other way. So I decided to create my own video player that can be run directly in the browser. Over time, many new features have been added, and I've probably refined this code more than 200 times now. The first feature I created was the ability to increase the volume by 400%, then I added support for .srt subtitle files. Often, subtitles that you download are made for deaf people, and that's great, but we who can hear don't always want this extra text. So I created a filter that removes this extra text, and displays all subtitles in the standard way. If you need the extra text, there's a button on the toolbar to turn it on. I've also made it so that all subtitles are displayed in a nice way with the same font, and you can adjust the size of the subtitles with the - and + buttons. I have also added a loop function that allows you to loop between two points in the video by first pressing L for the start point and then L again for the end point. The video will then loop between these two points until you press L again to exit the loop. There are also buttons to turn the subtitles on and off, and a button to turn full screen on and off. In my latest update, the player now remembers where you left off in a video, so you can pick up right where you left off next time you open it. Â© Johnny Heggelund
